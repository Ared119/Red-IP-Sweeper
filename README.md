# Red-IP-Sweeper
Red IP Sweeper is a simple batch file for Windows CMD that scans all IP addresses in a network! All you have to do is enter the network ID without the last dot. For example, "192.168.0". After pressing enter, Red IP Scanner will scan all IP addresses in the network and output either "UP" or "DOWN".
