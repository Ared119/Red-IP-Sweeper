# Red-IP-Scanner
Red IP Sweeper is a simple batch file for Windows CMD that scans all IP addresses in a network! All you have to do is enter the network ID without the last dot. For example, "192.168.0". After pressing enter, Red IP Scanner will scan all IP addresses in the network and output either "UP" or "DOWN". Further updates will be made to make this tool stronger and faster!

PLEASE READ: This IP scanner is for educational purposes only. If used with malicious intent, you may face legal consequences. Even though pinging is legal, it may be found as suspicious if it is performed in a public network. It is always reccomended to test it only on your own home network. I am not responsible for any of the consequences you may face.

Updates: 

1/19/2025: Red IP Scanner is released!!!!!
